### Water and underground rendering

Water rendering can be configured globally with `water-rendering` and overridden for each underground layer. `vanilla` keeps the original map shading; `fixed` applies a constant tint opacity; `depth` interpolates between minimum and maximum opacity according to water depth; `disabled` shows the block below the water. `color-source` selects whether the tint is blended with the water color or the block below it. All opacity and darkening values are between `0.0` and `1.0`.

The per-layer `water-rendering.scope` controls where its override applies. `region` (default) uses it only for pixels inside the layer's WorldGuard regions; outside pixels use the global water settings. `map` uses the layer's water settings across the whole minimap while the player is inside that layer, including surface pixels outside its regions. Outside pixels still use surface terrain and the layer's `darken` factor. The top-level `water-rendering` remains the default when no underground layer is active.

Underground layers require WorldGuard regions. With `no-opening-mode: descend`, each map column searches downward from `render-from-y` for `min-open-height` consecutive blocks listed in `transparent-blocks`. `min-y` can be a numeric Y coordinate or `region-floor`, which uses the minimum Y of the covering WorldGuard region; it must be at or below `render-from-y`. A column without a qualifying opening shows the darkened surface. `no-opening-mode: fixed` (the default) checks only `render-from-y` and retains the original slice there when no opening is found. There is no separate `enabled` switch.

An optional connectivity threshold excludes small isolated air or water pockets. `smart-descend-defaults.min-connected-columns` sets the default for all layers; a layer's `smart-descend.min-connected-columns` overrides it. `1` disables the connectivity check. Higher values require that many distinct horizontal columns in one six-directionally connected transparent space, searched within the current chunk and its eight neighbors. This is a local size check, not a pathfinding check from the player's position. Enabling it loads neighboring chunks during rendering and rerenders affected neighboring cached tiles after block changes.

```yaml
water-rendering:
  mode: depth
  min-opacity: 0.05
  max-opacity: 0.50
  depth-for-max-opacity: 12
  tint: "#3F9FD4"
  color-source: bottom

smart-descend-defaults:
  min-connected-columns: 1

underground-layers:
  flooded_cave:
    wg-regions: [my_flooded_cave]
    render-from-y: 50
    priority: 1
    darken: 0.5
    smart-descend:
      min-y: region-floor
      no-opening-mode: descend
      min-open-height: 2
      min-connected-columns: 8
      transparent-blocks: [AIR, CAVE_AIR, VOID_AIR, WATER]
    water-rendering:
      scope: map
      mode: fixed
      opacity: 0.15
      color-source: bottom
      underwater-darken: 0.10
```

Only blocks in `transparent-blocks` count as cave space; add `WATER` for flooded caves. Layer water settings not specified here inherit the global values. The tile cache is separated by rendering settings, so changes to these settings generate new tiles instead of reusing incompatible cached colors.

### Markers

Markers are just font images with special marks on texture, so they have same limitations:
- No animations. But you can replace the icon to another one every AsyncMarkerRenderEvent call using API.
- Texture size is limited to 256 x 254 pixels (two extra columns used for marks)
- Note that large amount of big images can significantly slow down resource pack loading. 


To add marker, drop your image to `markers` directory and type `/minimap admin reload`. New resourcepack will be generated. \
You can make images smaller/bigger using `markers.sizes` config property. Like in `player_small` default marker.

### Compatibility 

#### Core shaders and another plugins
Plugin uses `rendertype_text` shader, so shaders for hud or text decorations may not be compatible. In most plugins you must 
disable text decorations for NMinimap work.\
Patched shader examples for BetterHUD is already [provided](betterhud-patching.md). You can easily add compatibility using AI (or by hands if you are developer) via examples.

#### Minimap Mods

Plugin can turn off some mod-driven minimaps at all or while serverside minimap enabled:

![](images/example_4.gif)


Supported mods:
- [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap)
- [VoxelMap-Updated](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxelmap-updated)
- [JourneyMap](https://modrinth.com/mod/journeymap)
- Another mods do not have such functionality, or it is not documented. 

#### Iris/OptiFine shaders incompatibility

Compatibility cannot be added because Iris don't use core shaders. You can disable NMinimap for users with Iris using [NMinimapIrisBlocker](https://github.com/NezuShin/NMinimapIrisBlocker)  


![](images/iris_blocker_showcase.png)

#### Bedrock 

Bedrock is not supported yet due absolutely different render pipeline. Plugin will not allow bedrock players to turn on the minimap if [Geyser](https://modrinth.com/plugin/geyser) installed on server.\
Players with `nminimap.bedrock-bypass` can still use the commands.\
If you are Bedrock developer and want to contribute please [contact me](#help-and-support).

### How does it work?

#### Maps
Plugin spawns packet-based invisible item frames with a map in it and renders the map with special sequence on first row. 
Shader detects this row and places the map at corner of the screen. Vanilla maps still works (Except one map id used for display. Id is configurable).  
The first map column is also disabled for symmetry.

#### Markers

Marker images have for pixels with specific color on then's corners. For every combination of map style and screen corner image is being created. Four images in total \
Also color of image is used. Red is X position on map. Green is Y position on map. Blue is marker rotation.


### API

Change player's map settings
```java
public void changeSettings(Player p) {
    var player = NMinimap.getInstance().getPlayersWithMap().stream().filter(i -> i.getPlayer().equals(p)).findFirst().orElse(null);

    player.setEnabled(true);
    player.setScale(8);
    player.getRight(true);
    player.setRound(true);
}
```

Draw on map and add markers. Both events being called on every map redraw. 

```java
@EventHandler
public void drawDot(AsyncMapRenderEvent event){
    byte[] mapData = event.getMapData();

    //middle of the map
    int x = 64;
    int y = 64;

    //Accepts only colors from ColorUtil.colors. Another values will result transparent color
    mapData[x + (y * 128)] = ColorUtil.exactColor(ColorUtil.colors[10]);


    int anotherX = 1;//first row is reserved for internal use. First **column** is disalbed for symmetry.  Displayed map has resolution 127 x 127
    int anotherY = 1;

    //Similar to deprecated MapPalette.matchColor(). Will find most nearest color.
    mapData[anotherX + (anotherY * 128)] = ColorUtil.getNearestColor(Color.fromRGB(255, 0, 0));
}

@EventHandler
public void drawMarker(AsyncMarkerRenderEvent e){
    List<NMapMarker> markers = e.getMarkers();

    String markerIcon = "player";//Icon from NMinimap/markers directory

    //Add marker with fixed location
    markers.add(new LocationMarker(markerIcon, new Location(e.getPlayer().getPlayer().getWorld(), 1, 1, 1)));

    int positionMarkerX = 0;//Accepts values from -127 to 127. -127 - left. 127 - right
    int positionMarkerY = 0;//-127 - top. 127 - bottom
    int positionMarkerRotation = 0;//from 0 to 256. 0 points top, 128 points bottom

    //Add marker with relative position on map.
    markers.add(new PositionMarker(markerIcon, positionMarkerX, positionMarkerY, positionMarkerRotation));

}
```

### Running on spigot

Spigot is outdated server software and should not be used in production. However, it is possible to run NMinimap on Spigot.\
Main problem is that spigot, unlike paper, cannot load chunks asynchronously. To run on spigot, you need to set `max-render-threads` config property to `1`. Otherwise, the server will freeze on chunck generation.\
Also recommended to set `max-scale` to 1 or 2 to reduce server load.
